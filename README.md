IntentLimit will be a sort of personal toolbox for myself that contains all the 
different tools, exploits, scripts, etc I need for pentesting. This project is not
even close to being finished but it's making progress. 

Ps. Don't mind how shitty the code is, this is basically a beta and I don't do much
oop so it's a big learning experience.
