IntentLimit will be a sort of personal toolbox for myself that contains all the 
different tools, exploits, scripts, etc I need for pentesting. This project is not
even close to being finished but it's making progress. Also, this takes inspiration from the FuzzBunch
framework released in the shadowbroker leak.

run launch.sh for setup. only run for first time setup, after first run, use alias intentlimit
to run.

ex:

git clone https://github.com/elijah-bennett0/IntentLimit

cd IntentLimit

./launch.sh <-- setup & install

intentlimit <-- run intentlimit
